Mandelbrot Set Viewer
by Ian Mallett

Version 5.0 is the spiritual successor to Mandelbrot Set Viewer, although to my memory it inherits no code.  I wrote the basics of it right in front of someone, just to demonstrate.  I then went back and added many of the features in the original series.

Look through the variables in config.py, which will change the rendering properties.

Enjoy!
